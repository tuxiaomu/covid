__At least 69 athletes collapse in one month, many dead__

Nov 26, 2021

_Abstract_

The reports of athletes who suddenly collapse have been increasing noticeably lately. Heart problems such as heart inflammation are often the cause – one of the known life-threatening side effects of Covid vaccines, which even the manufacturers themselves warn against.
The current phenomenon is also evident if you simply look on Wikipedia at the list of footballers who have collapsed and died. The year 2021 stands out with 13 entries so far. In no other year mentioned have more footballers died during a game. And this list goes back to the year 1889. So it really is a historical event.

__Are An Alarming Number of Athletes Dropping Dead After Getting the COVID Jab?__

Nov 6, 2021

_Abstract_

We took a long time for this research, selecting each case individually. Was there a noticeably high number of 「sudden and unexpected」 deaths in sport and top-class sport until mid-2021? No official can (and will not) explain a possible accumulation since the start of gene vaccinations. According to the possibly blackmailed and bribed media and politics, these are unfortunate coincidences – although already 13-year-olds with heart problems fall over on the square.

__Teen equestrian star Cienna Knowles hospitalised with blood clots after Pfizer vaccine__

Oct 26, 2021

_Abstract_

A 「super healthy」 teen equestrian competitor who was hospitalised last week with blood clots in her chest has blamed the potentially 「life-changing」 injuries on the Pfizer vaccine.
However, authorities have not confirmed her condition is connected to the Pfizer shot – which to date has not been linked to blood clotting issues as a known side effect in Australia – with NSW Health urging the public to 「use credible sources of information」.
Cienna Knowles from the NSW Central Coast shared her experience in a series of viral social media posts, writing that she 「never wanted」 the Covid-19 vaccine as she was scared of side effects, but ultimately got it to keep her job.

__Jeremy Chardy: I regret getting vaccinated, I have series of problems now__

Sep 25, 2021

_Abstract_

Former world No. 25 Jeremy Chardy says he has a "series of problems" after taking the COVID-19 vaccine and his 2021 season is over. This summer, 34-year-old Chardy decided to get vaccinated and it didn't work out well for him.
Chardy, now ranked at No. 73 in the world, claims he is unable to train and play. "Since I got my vaccine [between the Olympics and the US Open], I have a problem, I have a series of problems. As a result, I can't train, I can't play.
[...] I prefer to take more time to heal myself and be sure that, in the future, I won't have any problems," Chardy told L'Equipe.

__Public needs to prep for vaccine side effects__

Nov 26, 2020

_Abstract_

The news last week that two COVID-19 vaccines had proved to be 95% efficacious in huge clinical trials provided much-needed hope as cases of the new coronavirus continued to soar. Less was written about the intense if transient side effects that the two vaccines, from Moderna and from Pfizer and BioNTech, can cause in some people—a reality that the public needs to be prepared for, vaccine experts and social scientists say. The side effects, including fatigue, muscle pain, joint pain and headache, were severe in less than 10% of people in the clinical trials of tens of thousands, and severe fever occurred in less than 2% of them. But tens of millions of people are soon expected to receive the vaccines, meaning hundreds of thousands will need to cope with the discomfort. "Take Tylenol and suck it up for a day," one scientist says.

_Abstract_

University of London professor Angus Dalgleish, who co-authored a paper in summer 2020 after spotting "unique fingerprints" in Covid-19 samples that point to genetic manipulation, says that he's been the victim of a "disgusting whitewash," and that anyone suggesting a non-natural origin for Covid-19 has been silenced by peers.

__Covid Vaccines Do not Stop Covid Spread: An analysis of current data__

_Abstract_

We conclude that whatever value vaccines may have in reducing hospitalization and mortality, they do not ‘work’ with the thoroughness government leaders claim,1 and certainly not to the degree that mandatory enforcement or vaccine passports could ever be justified in Canada as a reasonable limitation upon individual rights to bodily autonomy and Charter freedoms.

__An Australian Engineer Speaks Out - The Many Mysteries of Covid__

Oct 5, 2021

_Abstract_

In the process of getting to the bottom of the whole Covid/Vax thing I waded through more than 700 papers, videos, opinion pieces and articles. I talked to numerous medical professionals like nurses, doctors and paramedics, and I waded through data, LOTS OF IT. Perhaps most crucially, I did deep dives at the data behind the data that was bombarding us daily as gospel – which took a lot of digging. In the process I realised that very little, in fact almost nothing of significance that we were officially being told by the government or the MSM was remotely true. And not everyone that I talked to had the same story, so that led to more digging to get to the truth.

__‘We failed’: Danish newspaper apologises for not questioning government Covid-19 numbers__

Jan 14, 2022

_Abstract_

A Danish newspaper has apologised to its readers for not being critical enough in its reporting of government coronavirus case numbers.

__New data finds NSW COVID patients admitted for other reasons__

Jan 3, 2022

_Abstract_

New data shows a significant proportion of COVID patients in New South Wales are being admitted to hospital for reasons unrelated to the virus.
That includes bowel obstructions, broken bones, mental health issues and women giving birth.
The data – taken over two days – found 50 percent of COVID patients were hospitalised for other reasons on day one and almost 40 percent on day two.

__UK Health Authority Slammed By Watchdog For Misleading Claim That Unvaxx'd Have "32 Times" Risk Of COVID Death__

Nov 28, 2021

_Abstract_

Ed Humpherson, Director of U.K. Statistics Authority the Office for Statistics Regulation (OSR), has written to Emma Rourke, Director of Health Analysis at the Office for National Statistics (ONS) to criticise the agency for a report it put out in October claiming that: 「Between January 2nd and September 24th 2021, the age-adjusted risk of deaths involving coronavirus (COVID-19) was 32 times greater in unvaccinated people than in fully vaccinated individuals.」
As James Wells, a statistician who served as head of the ONS UK trade team until 2019, pointed out when he wrote to the OSR to complain about the report earlier this month, this statistic uses data from January 2nd to September 24th 2021, which includes the bulk of the winter deaths at a time when almost no one was vaccinated. This skews the implied vaccine effectiveness, as a fair comparison would only include periods when a significant proportion of the country was vaccinated.

## PAPER

__Innate Immune Suppression by SARS-CoV-2 mRNA Vaccinations: The role of G-quadruplexes, exosomes and microRNAs__

Jan 31, 2022

_Abstract_

However, both experimental and observational evidence reveals a very different immune response to the vaccines compared to the response to infection with SARS-CoV-2. As we will show, the genetic modifications introduced by the vaccine are likely the source of these differential responses. In this paper, we present the evidence that vaccination, unlike natural infection, induces a profound impairment in type I interferon signaling, which has diverse adverse consequences to human health.…These disturbances are shown to have a potentially direct causal link to neurodegenerative disease, myocarditis, immune thrombocytopenia, Bell’s palsy, liver disease, impaired adaptive immunity, increased tumorigenesis, and DNA damage. We show evidence from adverse event reports in the VAERS database supporting our hypothesis.

__Mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 Evolution Revealing Vaccine-Resistant Mutations in Europe and America__

Dec 7, 2021

_Abstract_

The importance of understanding SARS-CoV-2 evolution cannot be overlooked. Recent studies confirm that natural selection is the dominating mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 evolution, which favors mutations that strengthen viral infectivity. Here, we demonstrate that vaccine-breakthrough or antibody-resistant mutations provide a new mechanism of viral evolution. Specifically, vaccine-resistant mutation Y449S in the spike (S) protein receptor-binding domain, which occurred in co-mutations Y449S and N501Y, has reduced infectivity compared to that of the original SARS-CoV-2 but can disrupt existing antibodies that neutralize the virus. By tracking the evolutionary trajectories of vaccine-resistant mutations in more than 2.2 million SARS-CoV-2 genomes, we reveal that the occurrence and frequency of vaccine-resistant mutations correlate strongly with the vaccination rates in Europe and America. We anticipate that as a complementary transmission pathway, vaccine-breakthrough or antibody-resistant mutations, like those in Omicron, will become a dominating mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 evolution when most of the world’s population is either vaccinated or infected. Our study sheds light on SARS-CoV-2 evolution and transmission and enables the design of the next-generation mutation-proof vaccines and antibody drugs.

__Rapid Progression of Angioimmunoblastic T Cell Lymphoma Following BNT162b2 mRNA Vaccine Booster Shot: A Case Report__

Nov 25, 2021

_Abstract_

1. Soon after the initiation of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaigns, it appeared that the injection of mRNA vaccines may induce swelling of lymph nodes draining the injection site. Although considered as benign, this vaccine reaction sometimes complicated the interpretation of 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging for suspicion of a neoplastic process affecting lymph nodes.
2. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first observation suggesting that administration of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine might induce AITL progression. Several arguments support this possibility.
3. Our case first raises the question of the COVID-19 prevention strategy to be used in this patient which is currently poorly protected against COVID-19. On the short term, the only option is to recommend strict masking and social distancing, and to offer him anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody therapy in case of high-risk contact. On the longer term, the use of mRNA vaccines should clearly be avoided while other types of vaccines might be considered.

__The epidemiological relevance of the COVID-19-vaccinated population is increasing__

Nov 19, 2021

_Abstract_

High COVID-19 vaccination rates were expected to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in populations by reducing the number of possible sources for transmission and thereby to reduce the burden of COVID-19 disease. Recent data, however, indicate that the epidemiological relevance of COVID-19 vaccinated individuals is increasing.

__Community transmission and viral load kinetics of the SARS-CoV-2 delta (B.1.617.2) variant in vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals in the UK: a prospective, longitudinal, cohort study__

Oct 29, 2021

_Abstract_

It's expected that vaccination reduces the risk of delta variant infection and accelerates viral clearance. However, study finds that fully vaccinated individuals with breakthrough infections have peak viral load similar to unvaccinated cases and can efficiently transmit infection in household settings, including to fully vaccinated contacts. Host–virus interactions early in infection may shape the entire viral trajectory.

__Increases in COVID-19 are unrelated to levels of vaccination across 68 countries and 2947 counties in the United States__

Sep 30, 2021

_Abstract_

At the country-level, there appears to be no discernable relationship between percentage of population fully vaccinated and new COVID-19 cases in the last 7 days (Fig. 1). In fact, the trend line suggests a marginally positive association such that countries with higher percentage of population fully vaccinated have higher COVID-19 cases per 1 million people. Notably, Israel with over 60% of their population fully vaccinated had the highest COVID-19 cases per 1 million people in the last 7 days.

__Worse Than the Disease? Reviewing Some Possible Unintended Consequences of the mRNA Vaccines Against COVID-19__

May 10, 2021

_Abstract_

Speaking to Fox News host Laura Ingraham last week, Dr. Stephanie Seneff, a Senior Research Scientist at the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, discussed findings from her recent research paper. In her paper, Seneff described how vaccines induce toxic prion-like proteins that can trigger neurodegenerative diseases. “The CDC web site on prion diseases states that ‘prion diseases are usually rapidly progressive and always fatal,'” the paper states. “It is now believed that many neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) may be prion diseases, and researchers have identified specific proteinaceous infectious particles linked to these diseases.”, “The spike protein generated endogenously by the vaccine could also negatively impact the male testes,” the paper states, adding, “Several studies have now shown that the coronavirus spike protein is able to gain access to cells in the testes via the ACE2 receptor, and disrupt male reproduction.”

__SARS-CoV-2 RNA reverse-transcribed and integrated into the human genome__

Dec 13, 2020

_Abstract_

Prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding and recurrence of PCR-positive tests have been widely reported in patients after recovery, yet these patients most commonly are non-infectious. Here we investigated the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 RNAs can be reverse-transcribed and integrated into the human genome and that transcription of the integrated sequences might account for PCR-positive tests. In support of this hypothesis, we found chimeric transcripts consisting of viral fused to cellular sequences in published data sets of SARS-CoV-2 infected cultured cells and primary cells of patients, consistent with the transcription of viral sequences integrated into the genome. To experimentally corroborate the possibility of viral retro-integration, we describe evidence that SARS-CoV-2 RNAs can be reverse transcribed in human cells by reverse transcriptase (RT) from LINE-1 elements or by HIV-1 RT, and that these DNA sequences can be integrated into the cell genome and subsequently be transcribed. Human endogenous LINE-1 expression was induced upon SARS-CoV-2 infection or by cytokine exposure in cultured cells, suggesting a molecular mechanism for SARS-CoV-2 retro-integration in patients. This novel feature of SARS-CoV-2 infection may explain why patients can continue to produce viral RNA after recovery and suggests a new aspect of RNA virus replication.

__Imperfect Vaccination Can Enhance the Transmission of Highly Virulent Pathogens__

Jul 27, 2015

_Abstract_

Could some vaccines drive the evolution of more virulent pathogens? Conventional wisdom is that natural selection will remove highly lethal pathogens if host death greatly reduces transmission. Vaccines that keep hosts alive but still allow transmission could thus allow very virulent strains to circulate in a population. Here we show experimentally that immunization of chickens against Marek's disease virus enhances the fitness of more virulent strains, making it possible for hyperpathogenic strains to transmit. Immunity elicited by direct vaccination or by maternal vaccination prolongs host survival but does not prevent infection, viral replication or transmission, thus extending the infectious periods of strains otherwise too lethal to persist. Our data show that anti-disease vaccines that do not prevent transmission can create conditions that promote the emergence of pathogen strains that cause more severe disease in unvaccinated hosts.

## POLICY

__Will I be compensated if I have an adverse reaction to the vaccine?__

_Abstract_

While the Australian Government strongly supports immunisation, it is not compulsory.

最近，關於運動員突然倒下的報告明顯增多。心臟炎症等心臟問題往往是原因--這是新冠疫苗已知的威脅生命的副作用之一，連製造商自己都有相關警告。目前的現象也很明顯，如果你簡單地在維基百科上看一下倒地死的足球運動員名單。2021年非常突出，到目前為止有13個條目。在提到的其他年份中，沒有更多的足球運動員在比賽中死亡。而這份名單可以追溯到1889年。所以這真的是一個歷史性事件。

__公眾需要為疫苗副作用做好準備__

Nov 26, 2020

_摘要_

上周有消息稱，隨著新型冠狀病毒病例繼續飆升，兩種 COVID-19 疫苗在大規模臨床試驗中被證明有 95% 的有效性，提供了急需的希望。疫苗專家和社會科學家表示，關於這兩種疫苗（來自 Moderna 以及來自輝瑞和 BioNTech）可能對某些人造成的強烈的短暫副作用的報道較少——這是公眾需要做好準備的現實。在數萬人的臨床試驗中，嚴重的副作用包括疲勞、肌肉疼痛、關節疼痛和頭痛等，不到 10% 的人出現嚴重，不到 2% 的人出現嚴重發熱。但預計很快就會有數千萬人接種疫苗，這意味著數十萬人將需要應對這種不適。「服用泰諾並吸收一天，」一位科學家說。

__英國衛生局因誤導性地聲稱未接種疫苗的人有"32倍"的COVID死亡風險而遭到監察部門的抨擊。__

Nov 28, 2021

_摘要_

英國統計局統計監管辦公室（OSR）主任埃德-漢弗森（Ed Humpherson）致函國家統計局健康分析主任艾瑪-洛克（Emma Rourke），批評該機構在10月份發佈的一份報告中聲稱。"在2021年1月2日和9月24日之間，未接種疫苗的人涉及冠狀病毒（COVID-19）的年齡調整後的死亡風險是完全接種疫苗的人的32倍。"
正如在2019年之前擔任ONS英國貿易團隊負責人的統計學家詹姆斯-威爾斯在本月早些時候寫信給OSR抱怨該報告時指出，這項統計使用了2021年1月2日至9月24日的數據，這包括幾乎沒有人接種疫苗時的大部分冬季死亡。這歪曲了疫苗效力，因為公平的比較只包括全國相當一部分人接種疫苗的時期。

_摘要_

然而，实验和观察的证据显示，与感染SARS-CoV-2的反应相比，人体对疫苗的免疫反应非常不同。正如我们将展示的那样，疫苗所带有的基因修改可能是这些不同反应的来源。在本文中，我们提出的证据表明，与自然感染不同，疫苗接种会诱发I型干扰素信号的深度损害，这对人类健康有多种不利影响...这些干扰被证明与神经退行性疾病、心肌炎、免疫性血小板减少症、贝尔氏麻痹、肝病、适应性免疫受损、肿瘤生成增加和DNA损伤有潜在的直接因果关系。我们从VAERS数据库的不良事件报告中展示了支持我们假设的证据。

__新冠的進化機制揭示了病毒在歐洲和美國的抗疫苗性突變__

Dec 7, 2021

_摘要_

瞭解新冠進化的重要性是不容忽視的。最近的研究證實，自然選擇是新冠進化的主導機制，它傾向於加強病毒感染性的突變。在這裡，我們證明疫苗突破或抗體抗性突變提供了一種新的病毒進化機制。具體來說，發生在刺突蛋白受體結合域的抗疫苗突變Y449S和N501Y的共同突變，與原始SARS-CoV-2相比，感染性降低，但可以破壞現有的中和病毒的抗體。通過追蹤220多萬個SARS-CoV-2基因組中疫苗抗性突變的進化軌跡，我們發現，疫苗抗性突變的發生和頻率與歐洲和美國的疫苗接種率密切相關。我們預計，作為一種額外的傳播途徑，疫苗突破或抗體抗性突變，如Omicron中的突變，當世界上大多數人口要麼接種疫苗，要麼被感染的時候，將成為SARS-CoV-2進化的主導機制。我們的研究揭示了SARS-CoV-2的進化和傳播，並提供了設計下一代防突變的疫苗和抗體藥物的可能性。

__案例報告：BNT162b2 mRNA疫苗加強針注射後，誘發血管免疫性T细胞淋巴瘤加速產生__

_摘要_

1. 在抗SARS-CoV-2疫苗接種運動開始後不久，出現了注射mRNA疫苗可能會誘發注射部位引流的淋巴結腫大。儘管被認為是良性的，但這種疫苗反應有時會使18F-FDG PET/CT成像的解釋複雜化，以懷疑影響淋巴結的腫瘤性過程。
2. 據我們所知，這是第一個表明注射SARS-CoV-2疫苗可能誘發AITL進展的觀察。有幾個論點支持這種可能性。
3. 我們的病例首先提出了一個問題，即對目前對COVID-19保護不力的患者採用COVID-19預防策略。在短期內，唯一的選擇是建議嚴格的掩蔽和社會疏遠，並在有高風險接觸的情況下為他提供抗SARS-CoV-2抗體治療。從長遠來看，顯然應該避免使用mRNA疫苗，同時可以考慮使用其他類型的疫苗。

_摘要_

雖然人們期待新冠疫苗能夠降低Delta變體感染的風險並加速清除病毒。但是，研究發現，完全接種疫苗的突破性感染者的病毒負載峰值與未接種疫苗的病例相似，並能在家庭環境中有效地傳播感染，包括傳播給完全接種疫苗的接觸者。感染早期宿主與病毒的相互作用可能決定了整個病毒的發展軌跡。

__比疾病更糟糕？回顾针对COVID-19的mRNA疫苗可能产生的一些意外后果__

May 10, 2021

_摘要_

上周，麻省理工学院计算机科学和人工智能实验室的高级研究科学家Stephanie Seneff博士在接受福克斯新闻主持人Laura Ingraham的采访时，讨论了她最近研究论文的发现。在她的论文中，Seneff描述了疫苗如何诱发有毒的朊病毒样蛋白，从而引发神经退行性疾病。“CDC关于朊病毒疾病的网站指出，'朊病毒疾病通常是快速发展的，而且总是致命的'”，该论文指出。“现在认为许多神经退行性疾病，包括阿尔茨海默氏症、帕金森氏症和肌萎缩侧索硬化症（ALS）可能是朊病毒疾病，而且研究人员已经确定了与这些疾病有关的特定蛋白性感染颗粒。”，“疫苗内源性产生的穗状蛋白也可能对男性睾丸产生负面影响，”论文指出，“现在有几项研究表明，冠状病毒穗状蛋白能够通过ACE2受体进入睾丸的细胞，并破坏男性生殖。”

__新冠病毒核糖核酸反向整合到人類基因組中__

Dec 13, 2020

_摘要_

在康復後的病人中，長期的SARS-CoV-2核糖核酸脫落和PCR陽性檢測的復發被廣泛報道，然而這些病人最常見的是沒有感染性。在此，我們研究了SARS-CoV-2核糖核酸可以反向轉錄並整合到人類基因組中的可能性，而整合序列的轉錄可能是PCR陽性試驗的原因。為了支持這一假設，我們在已發表的SARS-CoV-2感染的培養細胞和患者的原始細胞的數據中發現了由病毒與細胞序列融合的嵌合轉錄物，這與整合到基因組中的病毒序列的轉錄相一致。為了從實驗上證實病毒逆向整合的可能性，我們描述了SARS-CoV-2核糖核酸可以在人類細胞中通過逆轉錄酶（RT）從LINE-1元件或HIV-1 RT逆轉錄，並且這些DNA序列可以整合到細胞基因組中並隨後被轉錄。在SARS-CoV-2感染或在培養細胞中接觸細胞因子時，人類的內源性LINE-1表達被誘導，這表明SARS-CoV-2在患者體內逆轉整合的分子機制。SARS-CoV-2感染的這一新特點可能解釋了為什麼患者在康復後能繼續產生病毒RNA，並提出了RNA病毒複製的一個新方面。

__不完善的疫苗接種可以加強高毒性病原體的傳播__

Jul 27, 2015

_摘要_

一些疫苗是否會推動毒性更強的病原體的進化？傳統觀點認為，如果宿主的死亡大大減少了傳播，自然選擇就會清除高度致命的病原體。因此，保持宿主活力但仍允許傳播的疫苗可能會使毒性很強的菌株在群體中循環。在這裡，我們通過實驗表明，對雞進行馬立克氏病病毒的免疫會增強毒性更強的毒株的生存能力，使高致病性毒株有可能傳播。通過直接接種或母體接種引起的免疫力延長了宿主的生存期，但並不能阻止感染、病毒複製或傳播，從而延長了病毒株的感染期，否則就會因過於致命而無法持續存在。我們的數據顯示，不能防止傳播的抗病疫苗可以創造條件，促進在未接種疫苗的宿主中引起更嚴重疾病的病原體菌株的出現。

## 政策

__如果我對疫苗有不良反應，我是否會得到賠償？__

_摘要_

雖然澳大利亞政府強烈支持免疫接種，但這並不是強制性的。人們、父母和照顧者保持著選擇是否接受疫苗接種的權利。\n政府目前沒有推行無過錯的COVID-19疫苗傷害賠償計劃。嚴重的副作用是非常罕見的。如果你認為你可能有不良反應，你應該立即尋求醫療護理。
